# Fluid Slider for Flutter

Inspired by [Virgil Pana](https://dribbble.com/virgilpana)

## Installation

Just add the package to your dependencies in the `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_fluid_slider: ^0.0.1
```

### Basic Usage

Place the `FluidSlider` in your widget tree.

```dart
FluidSlider(
  value: _value,
  onChanged: (double newValue) {
    setState(() {
      _value = newValue;
    });
  },
  min: 0.0,
  max: 100.0,
),
```

### Properties

- `value` : [**Required**] The currently selected value for this slider. The slider's thumb is drawn at a position that corresponds to this value.

- `min` : The minimum value the user can select. Defaults to `0.0`. Must be less than or equal to `max`.

- `max` : The maximum value the user can select. Defaults to `1.0`. Must be less than or equal to `min`.

- `start` : The widget to be displayed as the min label. For eg: an Icon can be displayed. If not provided the `min` value is displayed as text.

- `end` : The widget to be displayed as the max label. For eg: an Icon can be displayed. If not provided the `max` value is displayed as text.

- `onChanged` : [**Required**] Called during a drag when the user is selecting a new value for the slider

  by dragging.

  - The slider passes the new value to the callback but does not actually change state until the parent widget rebuilds the slider with the new value.

  - If null, the slider will be displayed as disabled.

- `onChangeStart` : Called when the user starts selecting a new value for the slider. The value passed will be the last `value` that the slider had before the change began.

- `onChangeEnd` : Called when the user is done selecting a new value for the slider.

- `labelsTextStyle` : The styling of the min and max text that gets displayed on the slider. If not provided the ancestor `Theme`'s `accentTextTheme` text style will be applied.

- `valueTextStyle` : The styling of the current value text that gets displayed on the slider. If not provided the ancestor `Theme`'s `textTheme.title` text style with bold will be applied .

- `sliderColor` : The color of the slider. If not provided the ancestor `Theme`'s `primaryColor` will be applied.

- `thumbColor` : The color of the thumb. If not provided the `Colors.white` will be applied.
